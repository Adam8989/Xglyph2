# Xglyph²

Xglyph² is an <a href="http://repo.xposed.info/">Xposed</a> module, that's adding some features to the glyph game in Niantic's augmented reality game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress">Ingress</a>.

It let's you
* correct glyphs by replacing outgoing glyphs with incoming ones
* automatically send MORE/LESS command glyphs to request a/no key
* automatically send COMPLEX/SIMPLE command glyphs to display glyphs faster/slower

As a kind of bonus, it also let's you
* request no key when hacking normal, not playing the glyph game

The module is based on the original <a href="https://github.com/xfunforx/IngressXglyph">Ingress Xglyph</a>, developed by xfunforx and me, but with a much nicer interface, imitating the interface of Ingress.
